Write a function called *findMinMax* to find the maximum and minimum elements of an array. Your answer should be returned in an array containing the min and max number, respectively.

Create a function called *fizzBuzz* to return 'Fizz', 'Buzz', 'FizzBuzz', or the argument it receives, all depending on the argument of the function, a number that is divisible by, 3, 5, or both 3 and 5, respectively.
When the number is not divisible by 3 or 5, the number itself should be returned.


Create a function called *aritGeo* that takes one argument, an Array. You are required to check if the array passed as an argument is arithmetic, geometric, neither arithmetic nor geometric in progression or if the array is empty.

For arithmetic progressions, return Arithmetic
For geometric progressions, return Geometric
For neither of the above, return -1
For an empty array, return 0
